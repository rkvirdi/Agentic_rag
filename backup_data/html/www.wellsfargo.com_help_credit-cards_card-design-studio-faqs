		<div class="c58answer"><p  >If you’re not sure about the file format, file size, or pixel dimensions, it may be faster and easier to identify an appropriate file before you browse and attempt to upload your file in the Card Design Studio service. If you’re using a PC, you can usually find file format, file size, and pixel dimensions by right-clicking on the file and selecting <strong>Properties</strong>. If you’re using a Mac, you can usually find pixel dimensions by clicking on the file and selecting <strong>Get Info</strong>. The method for finding this information will vary depending on your operating system.</p></div>
