 <h2>Understanding your auto loan</h2>
<p>
        <div class="c58" id="whatisasimpleinterestloan" data-cid="tcm:84-194334-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is a simple interest loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>Your Wells Fargo Auto loan is a simple interest loan. Simple interest is a method of allocating monthly loan payments between interest and principal. The amount of your payment allocated to interest is calculated based on your unpaid <a href="/help/loans/auto-loans-faqs/" id="3e7dc8a7-6bac-4637-9471-0e1df2dc34a2" data-content-id="8419422216" data-cid="tcm:84-194222-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-2806-32" class="c29link">principal balance</a>, the interest rate on your loan, and the number of days since your last payment.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If we receive a payment and it's been 29 days since your last payment, then you'll be charged 29 days of interest on the unpaid principal balance of your loan. The remainder of your payment is credited to principal and reduces the unpaid principal balance on your loan.</p></div>
	</div>

        <div class="c58" id="howisthedailyinterestamountcalculatedonmyautoloan" data-cid="tcm:84-194333-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">How is the daily interest amount calculated on my auto loan?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>With a simple interest loan, interest accrues daily. As you pay off the <a href="/help/loans/auto-loans-faqs/" id="3e7dc8a7-6bac-4637-9471-0e1df2dc34a2" data-content-id="8419422216" data-cid="tcm:84-194222-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-2806-32" class="c29link">principal balance</a>, the daily interest amount will decrease.</p>
<p>To calculate the daily interest amount, first convert the interest rate percentage into a decimal by dividing the interest rate by 100. Multiply that number by your principal balance, and then divide by the number of days in a year (365 or 366 for a leap year). This will give you the daily interest charge.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If the loan has a 9% interest rate and a $10,000 principal balance, you convert the interest rate into a decimal: 9 / 100 = .09, and calculate the daily interest charge: .09 x $10,000 / 365 = $2.47 daily interest.</p></div>

<div class="c58" id="howmuchofmymonthlypaymentisinterest" data-cid="tcm:84-194335-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">How much of my monthly payment is interest?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>With a simple interest loan, there's a daily interest amount and you'll pay interest on the number of days between your payments.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
Your current principal balance is $10,000.00, the interest rate is 9%, and 30 days have elapsed since your last payment posted to the account. If you make a payment of $250.00, then $73.97 will be applied to interest and the remainder of the payment will be applied to the principal. Your new principal balance is $9,823.97.</p>
<p>($10,000.00 x 9% / 365 days per year) x 30 days elapsed = $73.97 interest accrued</p>
<p>The process starts over until you make your next payment. Your new principal balance is $9,823.97, but this time 28 days have elapsed since your last payment. If you make a $250.00 payment, then $67.83 will be applied to interest and the remainder of the payment will be applied to principal. Your new principal balance is $9,641.80.</p>
<p>($9,823.97 x 9% / 365 days per year) x 28 days elapsed = $67.83 interest accrued</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you defer a monthly payment, this will extend the term of your loan, and the interest will continue to accrue until the next payment is made. The outstanding loan balance will continue to accrue interest until the loan is paid off.</p>
<p>The total interest paid over the term of your loan may be different from what's shown on your loan agreement. If you pay your loan early, the amount of interest will be less, and if you pay your loan late, the amount of interest will be more.</p></div>

        <div class="c58" id="whydoestheamountofinterestipaychangeeachmonth" data-cid="tcm:84-194336-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">Why does the amount of interest I pay change each month?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>The amount of interest paid each month changes because the daily interest amount decreases as the <a href="/help/loans/auto-loans-faqs/" id="3e7dc8a7-6bac-4637-9471-0e1df2dc34a2" data-content-id="8419422216" data-cid="tcm:84-194222-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-2806-32" class="c29link">principal balance</a> decreases.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the loan, the principal balance is higher, and as a result, the daily interest amount is higher. As you start paying down your principal balance, the amount of interest you pay each month decreases.</p>
<p>In addition, interest accrues daily, and the number of days between payments makes a difference. More days between payments results in more days of interest charges, and fewer days between payments results in fewer days of interest charges.</p></div>

		<div class="c58answer"><p>There may be a fee for missing a payment or making a late payment. You can find this information in your loan agreement.

<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
If the daily interest charge is $2.50, and it's been 30 days since your last payment was made, the interest due will be $75.00 ($2.50 x 30 days).</p>
<p>Let's use the same daily interest charge, but now say it's been 40 days since your last payment was made. The interest due will be $100.00 ($2.50 x 40 days).</p>

<li><strong>Service contracts</strong> (also referred to as extended warranties) provide coverage in the event that a major mechanical component of the vehicle, such as an engine, transmission, heating/cooling system, seal, gasket, and/or fuel system, needs repair. The coverage typically lasts for a specific period of time or vehicle mileage.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-theft protection</strong> includes devices or services, such as tracking, that make the vehicle (or the component of the vehicle) more difficult to steal or easier to recover if it is stolen. It can also provide a financial benefit after a theft.</li>
<li><strong>Surface protection</strong> for the interior or exterior of the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance packages</strong> are prepaid plans that typically cover scheduled maintenance, such as oil changes, on the vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>Credit life insurance</strong> pays off all or some of your loan if you pass away.</li>
<li><strong>Credit disability insurance</strong> assists with making your loan payments if you become unable to do so due to disability.</li>

 <h2>Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) coverage</h2>
<p><div class="c58" id="whatisguaranteedassetprotectiongap" data-cid="tcm:84-194385-16" data-ctid="tcm:91-6213-32">
		<h3 class="c58question">What is Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP)?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>GAP is an optional product that covers any "gap" between the amount owed on the loan and the vehicle’s value in the event of a total loss. Some exclusions apply. It's important to review the coverage details to understand the limitations of GAP coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
<br />
Your vehicle was in an accident and deemed a total loss. Your insurance company determines that the fair market value of the vehicle is $10,000, so that is what they paid out. The remaining loan balance on the vehicle is $13,000. After insurance, you still owe $3,000. If you have GAP, the remaining $3,000 may be covered. GAP may not cover late payments, late fees, or deferred payments.

		<h3 class="c58question">Is GAP the same as auto insurance?</h3>	
		<div class="c58answer"><p>No, GAP coverage only helps in the event of a total loss and is considered a supplement to your primary insurance. Auto insurance covers the vehicle, while GAP covers the loan.
